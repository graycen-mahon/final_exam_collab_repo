METHODOLOGICAL INFORMATION

Description of methods used for collection/generation of data:

For this study, the data was sampled by selecting the seed banks of 8 forb taxa and collected seeds from 29 different kangaroo rat mounds at 4 different locations. The locations are as follows; around the base of the mound (B), surrounding area of the mount (D), edge of Bouteloua eriopoda grass (E) and the inter space between the Bouteloua eriopoda grass (I). Each seed was marked for the location, mound number, species, and direction in the sample area.

Seed Collection.

Seeds were collected from 5 main species - GEUROS, KOBMYO, CARRUP, AREFEN, and MINOBT. Seeds were collected from the same plants that individual-level flowering phenology was done on. AREFEN stalks were bagged with organza bags before showing signs of senescence to ensure that early-flowered seeds would not be lost. Seed pods were collected in late August to late September. Seed pods were only collected when they were deemed “mature” - meaning they were brown and the seeds were ready to pop out. I visited each plot once per week throughout late August and late September to collect all seeds that were set. Seeds were put in a coin envelope that was taped at the corners to ensure that no seeds were lost. Envelopes were marked with the species, toothpick color, shrub number, plot number, number of inflorescences collected, and date of collection. Seeds were kept in the refrigerator in their respective envelopes until they were ready to be counted.

Seed Counts, Weights

To count the seeds, I broke up the dried bud with my fingers. I then counted all viable seeds. Seeds were considered “viable” if they looked and felt plump compared to obviously aborted seeds (shriveled and small in appearance). I separated the seeds from the dried bud and counted each seed individually. The counts were recorded and the seeds placed back into their respective envelopes, corresponding to which specific plant the seeds came from. The seeds were then weighed as a group with a microbalance.
