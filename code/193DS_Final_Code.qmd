## Introduction

○ To your specific analysis (biology or otherwise) with 3-5 citations (3-5 sentences)

For the first data set which is the study of the effects of Kangaroo Rat Mounds on Seed Banks of Grass and Shrublands at the Sevilleta National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, we analyzed the data in order to answer the question, "How does the total seed number differ between kangaroo rat mound locations?". Studies have shown that rodents, such as kangaroo rats, are important in seed dispersal and therefore the survival of different plant species while reducing water usage in drought ridden areas (Beck). In areas with high rates of drought, and low rodent populations, seed dispersal is less productive and therefore many plant species become endangered. Drought causes a decrease in seed and plant release height, which decreases seed terminal velocity and therefore possibility of germination (Johnson et al). It is important to study the effectiveness of kangaroo rat seed dispersal and the content of seed banks on kangaroo rat mounds for ecological purposes. The results of this study will allow for a better understanding of whether or not kangaroo rats are beneficial or harmful to the longevity of plant species.

# Problem 2

**Questions:** How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it?

## Introduction

○ To your specific analysis (biology or otherwise) with 3-5 citations (3-5 sentences)

For the second data set, which is the study of individual and community flowering phenology, seed counts and pollinator visitation rates in shrub and open plots across Niwot Ridge (the arctic tundra) we analyzed the data in order to answer the questions, "How does seed count vary with plot type (shrub or open), plant species, and total number of inflorescences? Is there a simpler model that explains seed count, and if so, what is it?". Studies show that increased shrub abundance can lead to increased levels of snow which can allow for "higher winter soil temperatures, greater microbial activity, and more plant-available nitrogen. High levels of soil nitrogen favor shrub growth the following summer" (Sturm et al). Each of these characteristics can lead to increased growth in spring and summer, altering species richness and plant community composition. According to Seaver's study from the Environmental Data Initiative, this can therefore effect the reproductive success of plants, which is studied through phenology- the timing of flowering in plants (Seaver). Flowering times are affected by surrounding plant and insect species, and studies show that the most common flowering time of plants is during seasons with higher biodiversity. Increased shrubs would indicate higher rates of flowering.
